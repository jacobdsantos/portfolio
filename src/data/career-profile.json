      "26-year-old Senior Threat Researcher who went from zero cybersecurity background to naming ransomware families, tracking APT groups, and delivering international workshops — in 3 years.",
      "I find threats before anyone else knows they exist, build tools that turn 8-hour workflows into 30 minutes, and share what I learn through workshops and research.",

      "Quick learner — completed a 2-year growth template in 1 year with zero prior background",

      "Persistent under pressure — survived an elimination-style 6-month training with zero failures",
      "Problem-solver — every tool was born from a real operational pain point",
      "Patient and thorough — willing to spend hours deep-diving malware samples and attack chains",
      "Pragmatic — focused on outcomes and career growth, not just learning for learning's sake",
      "Pioneer mindset — first on the team to adopt Gen AI, introduced AI-assisted reverse engineering company-wide",

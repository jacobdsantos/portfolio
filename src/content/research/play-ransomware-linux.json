  "summary": "Trend Micro threat hunters discovered the first Linux variant of Play ransomware specifically targeting ESXi environments. The analysis revealed infrastructure connections to Prolific Puma, a threat actor known for providing link-shortening services to cybercriminals. The ESXi variant shares code similarities with the Windows version but includes ESXi-specific routines for VM management and datastore encryption. This discovery demonstrates the continued trend of major ransomware groups developing dedicated Linux/ESXi payloads to maximize impact on enterprise virtualization infrastructure.",

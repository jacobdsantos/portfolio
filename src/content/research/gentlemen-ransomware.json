  "summary": "Gentlemen ransomware introduced a novel approach to defense evasion: rather than using a fixed BYOVD payload, the operators dynamically select and custom-patch anti-AV tools during the attack based on reconnaissance of the target's security stack. This article provides a full technical breakdown of their multi-stage infection chain, the adaptive evasion framework, encrypted C2 communication, and the Rust-based ransomware payload. Includes IOCs, MITRE ATT&CK mapping, and detection guidance.",

  "summary": "During monitoring of Agenda (Qilin) ransomware activities, campaigns were uncovered using the SmokeLoader malware and a newly identified loader named NETXLOADER. The addition of these tools to Agenda's arsenal demonstrates the group's continued evolution in delivery mechanisms and evasion capabilities. NETXLOADER features .NET-based obfuscation and dynamic payload retrieval, while SmokeLoader provides modular post-exploitation capabilities. The research documents the full kill chain from initial access through loader deployment to ransomware execution.",

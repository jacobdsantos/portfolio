  "summary": "Charon ransomware blurs the line between APT operations and cybercrime by adopting techniques previously attributed to Earth Baxia, a state-sponsored threat actor. The group leverages DLL sideloading through legitimate Microsoft Edge binaries, uses hybrid Curve25519/ChaCha20 encryption that makes file recovery virtually impossible, and employs multi-stage loaders to evade detection. This analysis maps the crossover between APT tradecraft and ransomware operations, including shared infrastructure indicators and tooling overlaps.",

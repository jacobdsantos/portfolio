  "summary": "Crypto24 is a ransomware group that stealthily blends legitimate tools with custom malware, using advanced evasion techniques to bypass security and EDR technologies. The group's toolkit includes living-off-the-land binaries mixed with custom-developed payloads, making detection through traditional signature-based methods extremely difficult. This research documents the full attack lifecycle, tool analysis, and provides behavioral detection strategies for identifying Crypto24 operations in enterprise environments.",
